# Blacklabelops Rsnapshotd

ATTENTION: This image has been migrated to Jobber and Jobber has different cron syntax! The cron schedule has 6 digits, one more than cron, please migrate!

This container offers rsnapshot functionality dockerized, parameterized and demonized. It is a side-car container for creating and managing container backups using rsnapshot. This container can backup
any arbitrary amount of containers and directories. Just hook up some containers and define your
backup volumes.

# Build

`docker buildx build --push -t pablokbs/rsnapshot-cron:latest --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm/v7`

# Make It Short

In short, this container can backup volumes and manage incremental backups of running containers.

Example container:

~~~~
docker run -d -p 8090:8080 --name jenkins_jenkins_1 blacklabelops/jenkins
~~~~

> The Jenkins container has a default docker volume under /jenkins

Creating a local backup of the running Jenkins container. This is only recommended For
linux system as you can loose file permissions and loose the ability to restore:

~~~~
$ docker run -d \
  --volumes-from jenkins_jenkins_1 \
	-v $(pwd)/snapshots/:/snapshots \
	-e "BACKUP_DIRECTORIES=/jenkins/ jenkins_jenkins_1/" \
	blacklabelops/rsnapshotd
~~~~

> Mounts all volumes from the running container and snapshots the volume /jenkins inside the local
snapshot directory under `jenkins_jenkins_1/`. Note: If you use Windows then you will have to replace $(pwd)
with an abolute path.

Browse the backup:

~~~~
$ ls snapshots/hourly.0/jenkins_jenkins_1/jenkins
Download metadata.log		plugins
config.xml					queue.xml.bak
hudson.model.UpdateCenter.xml	secret.key
identity.key.enc				secret.key.not-so-secret
init.groovy.d					secrets
jobs							updates
nodeMonitors.xml				userContent
nodes							war
~~~~

> Multiple invocations of the container will rotate backups. The default configuration sets up to 6 hourly backups.

# Setting Cron Schedule

You can override the schedule by using the following environment variables. Remember that they
have to contain valid cron syntax. ([Wikipedia Documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron))

* CRON_HOURLY
* CRON_DAILY
* CRON_WEEKLY
* CRON_MONTHLY

Example:

~~~~
$ docker run -d \
  --volumes-from jenkins_jenkins_1 \
  --name backupdemon \
  -v $(pwd)/snapshots/:/snapshots \
	-e "BACKUP_DIRECTORIES=/jenkins/ jenkins_jenkins_1/" \
  -e "CRON_HOURLY=0 20 * * * *" \
  -e "CRON_DAILY=0 0 2 1 * *" \
  -e "CRON_WEEKLY=0 0 1 * * 1" \
  -e "CRON_MONTHLY=0 0 3 20 * *" \
	blacklabelops/rsnapshotd
~~~~

> Will create backups on the local disk by the defined cron schedule.

# Logging

This container does not write a logfile by default. It's considered bad practise as logs
should be accessed by the command `docker logs`. There are use case where you want to
have additional log files, e.g. my use case is to relay log to Loggly [Loggly Homepage](https://www.loggly.com/).
I have added a routine for logging and it's activated by defining a logfile.

Environment Variable: LOG_FILE

First start the Jenkins example master:

~~~~
docker run -d -p 8090:8080 --name jenkins_jenkins_1 blacklabelops/jenkins
~~~~

> The Jenkins container has a default docker volume under /jenkins

Example for a separate volume with a logfile:

~~~~
$ docker run -d \
  --name backupdemon \
  --volumes-from jenkins_jenkins_1 \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/rsnapshotlogs \
  -v $(pwd)/snapshots/:/snapshots \
  -e "LOG_FILE=/rsnapshotlogs/rsnapshotd.log" \
  -e "BACKUP_DIRECTORIES=/jenkins/ jenkins_jenkins_1/" \
  -e "CRON_HOURLY=0 15 * * * *" \
  blacklabelops/rsnapshotd
~~~~

> You can watch the log by typing `cat ./logs/rsnapshotd.log`.

Now lets hook up the container with my Loggly side-car container and relay the log to Loggly! The Full
documentation of the loggly container can be found here: [blacklabelops/loggly](https://github.com/blacklabelops/fluentd/tree/master/fluentd-loggly)

~~~~
$ docker run -d \
  --volumes-from backupdemon \
  -e "LOGS_DIRECTORIES=/rsnapshotlogs" \
	-e "LOGGLY_TOKEN=3ere-23kkke-23j3oj-mmkme-343" \
  -e "LOGGLY_TAG=snapshotlog" \
  --name rsnapshotloggly \
  blacklabelops/loggly
~~~~

> Note: You need a valid Loggly Customer Key in order to log to Loggly.

## Vagrant

Vagrant is fabulous tool for pulling and spinning up virtual machines like docker with containers. I can configure my development and test environment and simply pull it online. And so can you! Install Vagrant and Virtualbox and spin it up. Change into the project folder and build the project on the spot!

~~~~
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
[vagrant@localhost ~]$ cd /vagrant
[vagrant@localhost ~]$ docker-compose up
~~~~

> Jenkins will be available on localhost:9200 on the host machine. Backups run
in background.

Vagrant does not leave any docker artifacts on your beloved desktop and the vagrant image can simply be destroyed and repulled if anything goes wrong. Test my project to your heart's content!

First install:

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
